# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: It is always infront of me even in my office or at home. Helpful creation

* Behavioral: This image of sticky note always help me to keep me on track of the list which need to be follow or need to be done. Will say is much better then mobile reminder. Always infront of me.

* Reflective: As mention sticky note is always infront of as my cell phone. Cell phone most of time distract you. But sticky not is infornt of me and my eyes remind me that need to do this task. Moreover, sticky note come with different color which also give charm about to use it more often for the reminder.

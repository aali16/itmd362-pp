# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://www.google.com/design/spec/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-readability
* How you implemented it in your sketch: First, my target will be the to make the page more clear and readable, and easy access for students. Will also show additionl help & support option for any troubleshooting. Most of the option will be available on touch of a button. With that touch of button feature it will help student to navigate easily and can go back and forth between pages.  

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Secondly, I will add some grapically, small 3d animinated and eye catching icons which help users or student that this icon is for support or for iit alert, news etc. Eye catching icon always attract users to click on the icon to see what the treasure inside it.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/data-formats.html
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Thirdly, want to add security implementation, where there is a login there has to be a security. To accomplish this will add the feature of date and time just under the login button, with this feature will also add the attempts to login feature. After 5 login, account will lock for secuirty purpose. Have to call support to unlock the account.
